# Let's Write some C

In a new directory, create a C file:

```c
void say_hello();

int main() {
    say_hello();
    return 0;
}
```

Now copy `libex03_rust_from_c.so` (or `.dylib` etc) into your C source directory. On Mac/Linux, compile with:

```bash
cc rust_from_c.c -o rust_from_c -L. -lex03_rust_from_c
```

Run `./rust_from_c` and it prints "Hello, World from Rust."

> On Linux, you may need `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./rust_from_c`. Linux doesn't look in the current directory by default!

## This is Painful - Automate!

There's a script in the repo "c" directory called `build_linux.sh`. It makes this a lot easier:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR lets you specify where the build will go
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="tmp" cargo build
# Since we know the output, we can copy it
cp tmp/debug/libex03_rust_from_c.so .
# Clean up afterwards!
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="tmp" cargo clean
# Invoke the C compiler
cc rust_from_c.c -o rust_from_c -L. -lex03_rust_from_c
# Run it, including the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./rust_from_c
```
