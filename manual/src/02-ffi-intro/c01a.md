# Static Linkage

Let's do the same thing, but statically linked. It's a lot easier.

> This makes some UNIX people grumpy. Every binary has a copy of its dependencies when you statically link. So you're using more disk space, you can't update a single file and fix all the binaries that use it (useful for security). On the other hand, your binary is self-contained, no more `LD_LIBRARY` fights and it fits better with the Rust way. So be prepared to be flexible!

In your `Cargo.toml`, change the `crate-type`:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib"] # Will create .a on Linux & Mac, .lib on Windows
```

Now when you build, you produce a `.a` file (or a `.lib` on Windows, which likes to be special).

Now you can simplify your `build_linux.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Constrain the build location
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="tmp" cargo build
# You need the .a file now
cp tmp/debug/libex03a_rust_from_c_static.a .
# Cleaning up makes people happy
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="tmp" cargo clean
# Include the .a like any other C .a file in your build command
cc rust_from_c.c -o rust_from_c_static libex03a_rust_from_c_static.a
# Runs with no linkage magic
./rust_from_c_static
```

## Size

Your statically linked `rust_from_c_static` binary is 4.5 Megabytes. Your dynamically linked `rust_from_c` is 16kb (with a 3.7 mb dynamic library in tow). We're not doing any sort of optimization, but that's why the UNIX people worry.

> The original PDP-11 maxed out at 4Mb of RAM. The PDP-7 that ran a mini-UNIX had a maximum of 8kb!
