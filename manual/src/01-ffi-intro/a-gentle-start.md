# A Gentle Start

Let's start gently, with a simple example.

You've all written:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Chances are pretty good that at some point in your career,
you've written this, too:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Let's combine the two, and make "Hello World" as a C library!

> "Hello World" as a cloud managed service probably exists, too. It probably even uses Kubernetes.
